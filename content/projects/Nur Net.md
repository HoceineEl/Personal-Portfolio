## Nur Net Browser Extension

Introducing Nur Net, your shield against distractions. This Chrome and Firefox extension empowers you to take charge of your online journey, redirecting your focus towards more meaningful content. Gain control of your online experience and stay focused on what matters most.

## Project Overview

Nur Net shields against distractions by blocking intensive websites and redirecting users to meaningful content. This project aligns with the following key principles:

- **Intelligent Blocking:** Nur Net intelligently identifies and blocks intensive websites, promoting a more focused and mindful online experience.

- **Customizable Settings:** Tailor your blocking preferences with Nur Net. Add custom websites to the blocklist, ensuring you have control over what to restrict.

- **Redirect to Positive Content:** Nur Net goes beyond blocking; it guides you towards positivity. When attempting to access restricted content, Nur Net redirects you to Da'awah videos, Quranic verses, or other uplifting material.

- **Personalized Protection:** Specify websites you want to block, aligning Nur Net with your unique preferences and goals.

Embrace the power of Nur Net to break free from distractions, refocus on what truly matters, and enjoy a more mindful browsing journey.
