## Hangman Game

Embark on a nostalgic journey into the early days of my JavaScript learning with the Hangman Game—a project that not only entertains but also reflects my growth and problem-solving skills. Dive into the fun side of programming as you explore the principles of this classic word-guessing game.

## Project Overview

The Hangman Game is a web-based project designed to provide an engaging and interactive experience while showcasing the foundational concepts of JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and more. Key aspects include:

- **Learning Journey:** A reflection of my early days in learning JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and web development.
- **Logical Thinking:** Hone your logical thinking skills through the entertaining and challenging Hangman game.

## Game Principles

The Hangman Game operates on a simple yet intriguing set of principles:

1. **Word Selection:** The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list in categories like animals, fruits, vegetables, and cities.
2. **User Interaction:** Players guess letters one by one to uncover the hidden word.
3. **Limited Attempts:** A set number of incorrect guesses is allowed (represented by the "hangman" figure).
4. **Visual Feedback:** The interface dynamically updates to reveal correct guesses and display the progress.
5. **Win or Lose:** Players win by guessing the entire word before running out of attempts.

## Demo and Exploration
