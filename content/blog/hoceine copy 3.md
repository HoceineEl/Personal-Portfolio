# SSR vs. CSR: Unraveling the Mystery of Rendering in Web Development

In the world of web development, rendering plays a crucial role in how your web pages are delivered to users. Two common methods for rendering web pages are **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** and **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**. Each approach has its own set of advantages and trade-offs. In this blog post, we'll explore the differences between SSR and CSR and when to use each.

## What Is Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?

Server-Side Rendering, as the name suggests, involves rendering web pages on the server before sending them to the client's browser. This means that the server generates the complete HTML document that is then displayed to the user.

### Advantages of SSR:

- **SEO-Friendly:** SSR is inherently more SEO-friendly because search engine bots can easily crawl and index the content since it's available in the initial HTML response.
- **Fast Initial Load:** Users get to see the content more quickly because they receive the pre-rendered HTML from the server.
- **Improved Performance:** SSR can reduce the load on the client's device, leading to better performance.

### Code Example (Node.js with Express and EJS):

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const ejs = require("ejs");
const app = express();

app.set("view engine", "ejs");

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.render("index", { message: "Hello from the server!" });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});
```

## What Is Client-Side Rendering (CSR)?

Client-Side Rendering involves sending a minimal HTML document to the client, often containing placeholders for content. The actual content is loaded and rendered in the browser using JavaScript.

### Advantages of CSR:

- **Interactivity:** CSR provides a more interactive and dynamic user experience since content can be updated without reloading the entire page.
- **Efficiency:** It can reduce the load on the server because it only sends the initial HTML structure.

### Code Example (React):

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello from the client!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```
